This is the classic game **Minesweeper** built as a single page application with vanilla JS (i.e., no framework dependency).

Stack:
- HTML, JS, and CSS
- Webpack for bundling

## Development
To start development, you need node v16 (the dev server doesn't work on v18 *yet*). Once you know you have this, you can do the following:
1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`

## Running Locally
After running the commands to start development, open in a browser: `http://localhost:4200`

## Live Demo
The live site is here: [Minesweeper](https://mnswpr.com)
