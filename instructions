        <span class="body hint">Clicking an open cell that has the correct number of flagged neighboring bombs will open all remaining unopened neighbor cells all at once. If an incorrect number of neighbors are flagged, or all neighbors are flagged or open, clicking the cell has no effect. If an incorrect neighbor is flagged, this will cause instant death.</span>
